*  Equation of the equinoxes complementary terms, consistent with

*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  canonical model.
*
*  Given:
*     DATE1,DATE2   d    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
*
*  Returned:
*     iau_EECT00    d    complementary terms (Note 2)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The "complementary terms" are part of the equation of the
*     equinoxes (EE), classically the difference between apparent and
*     mean Sidereal Time:
*
*        GAST = GMST + EE
*
*     with:
*
*        EE = dpsi * cos(eps)
*
*     where dpsi is the nutation in longitude and eps is the obliquity
*     of date.  However, if the rotation of the Earth were constant in
*     an inertial frame the classical formulation would lead to apparent
*     irregularities in the UT1 timescale traceable to side-effects of
*     precession-nutation.  In order to eliminate these effects from
*     UT1, "complementary terms" were introduced in 1994 (IAU, 1994) and
*     took effect from 1997 (Capitaine and Gontier, 1993):
*
*        GAST = GMST + CT + EE
*
*     By convention, the complementary terms are included as part of the
*     equation of the equinoxes rather than as part of the mean Sidereal
*     Time.  This slightly compromises the "geometrical" interpretation
*     of mean sidereal time but is otherwise inconsequential.
*
*     The present routine computes CT in the above expression,
*     compatible with IAU 2000 resolutions (Capitaine et al., 2002, and
*     IERS Conventions 2003).

*     iau_FAL03    mean anomaly of the Moon

*     iau_FAD03    mean elongation of the Moon from the Sun

*     iau_FAVE03   mean longitude of Venus
