      SUBROUTINE iau_SEPP ( A, B, S )

*   i a u _ S E P P
*  - - - - - - - - -
*
*  Angular separation between two p-vectors.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  vector/matrix support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     A        d(3)      first p-vector (not necessarily unit length)
*     B        d(3)      second p-vector (not necessarily unit length)
*
*  Returned:
*     S        d         angular separation (radians, always positive)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) If either vector is null, a zero result is returned.
*
*  2) The angular separation is most simply formulated in terms of
*     scalar product.  However, this gives poor accuracy for angles
*     near zero and pi.  The present algorithm uses both cross product
*     and dot product, to deliver full accuracy whatever the size of
*     the angle.
*
*  Called:
*     iau_PXP      vector product of two p-vectors
*     iau_PM       modulus of p-vector
*     iau_PDP      scalar product of two p-vectors

*     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
*     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
*     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
*     with the following requirements:
*
*     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
*        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
*        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
*        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
*        endorsed by SOFA.
*
*     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
*        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
*        from the original SOFA software.
*
*     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
*        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
*        thereof such as changes of case.
*
*     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
*        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
*        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
*        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
*
*     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
*        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
*        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
*        derived work.
*
*     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
*     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
*     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
*     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
*     such, as explained above.

*  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
*     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
*     by inappropriate modification.
