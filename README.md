To add a directory to the testing framework, cd into this directory, and use `./addNew.sh <path-to-directory>`.
Then, use `./run_test.sh` to test all .bats files in the subdirectories of /source/. 

Other commands include:
- `./addMakefile.sh <directory>`: open a lightweight Makefile generator.
- `./cleanup.sh <directory>`: a script to help delete and/or backup your .bats files.
